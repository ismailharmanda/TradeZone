<h2>This work is a micro clone e-commerce app made using <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com">FakeStoreApi</a>.</h2>

<br/>

You can watch the Demo Record: [DEMO](https://streamable.com/7a8dfg)

<br/>

<h3>You can log in with any <span style="color:rgb(255,119,5);font-weight:bold">email</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255,119,5);font-weight:bold">password</span> that complies with the validation rules.</h3>

<br/>

<h3>In the project, I used the endpoints provided by fakestoreapi as much as possible. Since I could not find answers to some needs in the endpoints, I installed the necessary logics in the frontend. One of them was for the search feature. Apart from that, I simulated api calls as much as possible.</h3>

<h2 style="color:rgb(255,119,5);font-weight:bold;text-align:center" >Getting Started</h2>
<br/>

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

<br/>

> ## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:DevelopmentHiring/IsmailHarmanda.git
```

> cd into the directory, install dependencies.

```sh
$ cd IsmailHarmanda
$ yarn
```

<br/>

> ## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

<br/>

> ## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

<br/>

## Congratulations! üéâ

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ü•≥

# Troubleshooting

If you get an error message like <kbd>error Your Ruby version is 2.6.8, but your Gemfile specified 2.7.5</kbd> or something like that you may need to upgrade your shell ruby version.

- You may use http://rbenv.org/ or https://rvm.io/ to install and use required version.

if you have problems with installing pods, you can go to ios folder and type:

```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

and start the project again.

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.
